Step1

Java File --> .java


Step2

Compile .java using javac compiler

.class file as output --> byte code


Step 3

Java code Execution

Byte code runs only in JVM environment

Load class file to JVM env

Order of loading

Bootstrap --> jars 
Extension --> jre/extension jar
system  --> class path --> drivers, framework level jar
user defined --> user defined class


Step4

Break the code into pieces

heap,stack,method area,pc register, native area

Step5
execution engine process the byte code
converts it into native code(0,1)---> machine level
