Lab Exercise No:1

Exercise Objective(s):Polymorphism

Exercise:Create a class called Worker. Write classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker that inherit from
Worker.Every worker has a name and a salaryrate. Write method Pay (int hours) to compute 
the week pay of every worker.  A Daily worker is paid on the basis of the number of days 
she/he works.The salaried worker gets paid the wage for 40 hours a week no matter what the
actual hours are.  Test this program to calculate the pay of workers. 

Recommended duration: 20 Mins

Solution Guidance (if applicable): NA


Lab Exercise No:2

Exercise Objective(s):Implementation of an interface

Exercise:Createa package called bank with the following Interfaces.

			<Interface> Account





<Interface>DepositAcc				<Interface>LoanAcc



			<Interface> Interest



	

<Interface>CreditInterest				<Interface>DebitInterest


1.	<Interface> Account
Data members: Four String variables to hold the account type “Savings, Fixed,PersonalLoan,
HousingLoan”
Methods:  createAcc()

2.	<Interface>DepositAcc
Methods:  withdraw (), deposit(),getBalance()

3.	<Interface>LoanAcc
Methods:  repayPrincipal (),payInterest (),payPartialPrincipal ()

4.	<Interface>Interest
Data members:  Four double variables to hold the interest percentage of Savings account, Fixed
deposit account,PersonalLoan account and HousingLoan account.
Methods:  calcInt()

5.	<Interface>CreditInterest
Methods:  addMonthlyInt(),addHalfYrlyInt(),addAnnualInt()

6.	<Interface>DebitInterest
Methods:  deductMonthlyInt(),deductHalfYrlyInt(),deductAnnualInt()


Create a package called BankImpl and create the following classes in it.

1.	SavingsAcc which implements DepositAcc  and CreditInterest
2.	FDAcc which implements DepositAcc  and CreditInterest
3.	PersonalLoanAcc which implements LoanAcc and DebitInterest
4.	HousingLoanAcc which implements LoanAcc and DebitInterest

Now create a class called MyAccount and create instances of all the accounts and generate appropriate output.
